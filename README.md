# Hidden-Communication-Steganography-and-Integrity-Check

Summary
The objective of the project is to demonstrate and illustrate the art of hidden communication using steganography.
The project aims to hide text or image given as input by the user in a selected carrier image of the user’s choice.
The project also provides hidden communication via steganography with the help of a password and XOR encryption.

The project contains the following methods:

1)Text encryption in image with LSB manipulation

a. Grayscale Image

b. Colour Image

2)Encryption of an image into a carrier image incorporating a XOR based password/key along with LSB manipulation.
